# Self-Driving Car Simulation (No Libraries)

This project is a simple 2D simulation of a self-driving car environment, built purely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, without relying on any external game or physics libraries.

## Project Goal

The main goal is to simulate a car that can perceive its environment (road borders and other traffic) using sensors and eventually learn to navigate the road autonomously.

## Current Features

*   **HTML Canvas Rendering:** The simulation is drawn on an HTML canvas.
*   **Road:** A multi-lane road with borders and dashed lane markings.
*   **Player Car:**
    *   Controlled using arrow keys (forward, reverse, left, right).
    *   Blue color.
    *   Equipped with sensors that detect road borders and other cars.
    *   Collision detection: Turns gray when it collides with road borders or traffic.
*   **Dummy Traffic:**
    *   Multiple cars moving straight ahead at constant, predefined speeds.
    *   Red color.
    *   No sensors or user controls.
    *   Act as obstacles for the player car.
*   **Basic Physics:** Simple acceleration, friction, handling, and collision detection.

## File Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the canvas and includes the necessary JavaScript files.
*   `style.css`: Contains basic CSS rules for styling the page and canvas.
*   `main.js`: The entry point of the simulation. Initializes the canvas, road, player car, and traffic. Contains the main animation loop (`animate`) that updates and draws all elements.
*   `car.js`: Defines the `Car` class.
    *   Handles both `PLAYER` and `DUMMY` car types.
    *   Includes logic for movement (player controls and dummy movement), collision detection (`#assessDamage`), polygon creation (`#createPolygon`), and drawing.
*   `road.js`: Defines the `Road` class, responsible for calculating road geometry (lanes, borders) and drawing the road.
*   `sensor.js`: Defines the `Sensor` class used by the player car to detect obstacles via ray casting.
*   `controls.js`: Defines the `Controls` class that listens for keyboard events to control the player car.
*   `utils.js`: (Assumed) Contains utility functions like linear interpolation (`lerp`) and polygon intersection (`polysIntersect`).

## How to Run

1.  Clone or download the repository.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser that supports HTML5 Canvas and modern JavaScript.
3.  Use the arrow keys to control the blue car.

## Next Steps (Potential)

*   Implement a neural network for the car's brain.
*   Train the car to drive autonomously using the sensor data.
*   Improve traffic behavior (e.g., lane changing, varying speeds).
*   Enhance visuals and physics.

## üöó Project Structure

The project is organized into the following phases:
