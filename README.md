# Self-Driving Car Simulation Project

This project aims to develop an autonomous vehicle simulation from scratch using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project follows a step-by-step approach, with each phase stored in separate directories.

## 🚗 Project Structure

The project is organized into the following phases:

1. **Car Control**
   - Basic car movement with keyboard controls
   - Canvas-based rendering
   - Physics simulation (acceleration, friction)

2. **Road Drawing** (Coming Soon)
   - Lane creation and rendering
   - Road boundaries
   - Scrolling road effect

3. **Artificial Sensors** (Coming Soon)
   - Raycasting implementation
   - Obstacle detection
   - Visual feedback for sensor data

4. **Traffic Simulation** (Coming Soon)
   - Random vehicle generation
   - Collision detection
   - Traffic behavior patterns

5. **Neural Network** (Coming Soon)
   - Implementation of neural network
   - Evolutionary algorithms
   - Reward-penalty system for learning
